## Fun with Make

Today I will be talking about [Makefiles](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). Makefiles are really handy and as you'll see they have many, many uses. if you're using a mac or Linux machine then you should have `Make` installed already. If you're using windows you may need to [install it](https://linuxhint.com/install-use-make-windows/).

### Prerequisites

1. Make installed and running correctly
2. Basic knowledge of the terminal / commandline

### The basics

So what is a Makefile anyway? A Makefile is a program building tool which runs on Unix, Linux, and their various builds and variations. In this guide, you will see that a `Make` can do a fair few things.

### Variables

Variables inside a Makefile can be defined in the following ways:

```Makefile
name = value - recursively expanded variable
name := value - Simply expanded variable
name ::= value - Simply expanded variable

```

So whats the difference? Simply expanded variables are scanned only once where as, the recursively expanded variables are expanded whenever the variable is substitued for another string.

```Makefile

foo = $(bar)
bar = $(boo)
boo = wow!

all:;echo $(foo)
```

This will echo: `wow! $(foo) expands to $(bar) which expands to $(boo) which finally expands to wow!.`

You can read more on variables [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Using-Variables.html)

Ok. Just say I want to use the variable and I need to ensure it has a value. You could do something like:

```Makefile
  @$(if $(strip $(KMS_KEY)),,$(error KMS_KEY [$(KMS_KEY)] needs a value))
```

This will echo: `Makefile:14: \*\*\* KMS_KEY [] needs a value. Stop.`

Here we use a text function to remove the white space, with an `if` directive, more on these later.

You can read more on text functions [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Text-Functions.html)

You can also use conditional variable assignment like:

```Makefile
cond ?= another value
anotherCond ?= default value
cond = some value

conditionalVars:
	@echo $(cond)
	@echo $(anotherCond)

```

This will echo:

`another value`

`default value`

if I remove the default value then I will get the value i assigned:

```Makefile
cond ?=
anotherCond ?= default value
cond = some value

conditionalVars:
	@echo $(cond)
	@echo $(anotherCond)

```

This will echo:

`some value`

`default value`

### Rules

Rules are commands that run targets. An example of a rule:

```Makefile
rule: [target]
```

A more concise example:

```Makefile
NAME="test me"

exportTest:
	@echo $(NAME)
```

This will echo: test me

You can read more about rules [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Rules.html)

So what else can you do with Make? Well, lots.

How about your need to export a value and use it somewhere else?

```Makefile
export TEST_ME = Make me

exportTest:
	@echo ${TEST_ME}
```

This will echo: `Make me`

This configuration can be handy when you're building pipelines and your needing to export values dynamically.

### Conditionals

Conditional directives can be handy for various tasks. The syntax of them is as follows.

`conditional-directive`

`text-if-true`

`endif`

The ifeq directive lines of the makefile following the ifeq are obeyed if the two arguments match; otherwise they are ignored.

```Makefile
directivesTest:
ifeq ($(empty_var), ok)
	echo "empty_var equals ok"
else
	echo "empty_var does not"
endif
```

This will echo `empty_var does not`

The lines of the makefile following the ifneq are obeyed if the two arguments do not match; otherwise they are ignored.

```Makefile
directivesTest:
ifneq ($(empty_var), ok)
	echo "empty_var equals ok"
else
	echo "empty_var does not"
endif
```

This will echo `empty_var equals ok`

More on conditionals [here](https://gnu.org/s/make/manual/html_node/Conditional-Syntax.html)

Just before we go... You may have noticed a few things.

### Execution

The `@` symbol. Adding before a command this will stop the command from being printed.

The `$$` symbols. Adding this is how to use a variable in `bash` or `sh`

You can read more about it [here](https://www.gnu.org/s/make/manual/html_node/Setting.html)

### Functions

```Makefile
testTarget:
	@echo $(shell ls)
```

This will echo a list of files in the folder you're running the target in.

what about something more advanced like this?

```Makefile
testTarget:
	$(eval STACK_STATUS=$(shell aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name my-cloudformation-stack --query 'Stacks[0].StackStatus' --output text))
```

This will store the status of a [stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-stack.html) in a variable called `STACK_STATUS` which you can use in different parts of your `Make` target.

Well I hope that you enjoyed learning about `Make`. This article has just scratched the surface of what can be done using `Makefiles`.
